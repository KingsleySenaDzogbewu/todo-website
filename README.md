Todo List Website

This is a simple web application that allows you to create, manage, and organize tasks you want to complete in the future, along with their intended dates.

How it Works
Type your task into the input bar and select your date from the date picker. Click on the add button to add your task to a list. Every todo has two buttons; a delete button and an edit button.
The delete button removes a task and the edit button modifies an existing task.
